## 🎨 Customization Guide

### colors
The color scheme is defined in `css/style.css` under the `:root` pseudo-class. Change these variables to update the theme globally:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #0A192F; /* Deep Navy */
    --accent-color: #D4AF37;  /* Gold */
    --text-light: #f4f4f4;    /* Off-white text */
    /* ... */
}
```

### Images
Currently, the website uses placeholder images from `placehold.co`. To customize:
1.  Place your project images in an `images/` directory.
2.  Update the `src` attributes in the HTML files:
    ```html
    <!-- Before -->
    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400..." alt="...">

    <!-- After -->
    <img src="images/your-project-image.jpg" alt="Description">
    ```
